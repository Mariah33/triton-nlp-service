# Data Type Detection: Regex vs ML Models

## Comparison of Approaches

### 1. Regex-Based Approach (Original)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast and lightweight
- ✅ Deterministic results
- ✅ No GPU required
- ✅ Easy to understand and debug
- ✅ No model downloads needed
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Low latency (< 1ms)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Rigid patterns, easy to break
- ❌ High false positive/negative rates
- ❌ Can't understand context
- ❌ Difficult to maintain patterns for all variations
- ❌ Language/locale specific
- ❌ Can't handle obfuscated or partial data

**Best for:**
- Simple, well-formatted data
- Known patterns
- High-speed requirements
- Resource-constrained environments

### 2. ML-Based Approach (New)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Context-aware detection
- ✅ Handles variations and noise
- ✅ Multi-language support
- ✅ Continuous improvement with new models
- ✅ Detects obfuscated/partial data
- ✅ Higher accuracy for complex cases
- ✅ Learns from examples

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires GPU for best performance
- ❌ Higher latency (10-100ms)
- ❌ Needs model downloads (1-5GB)
- ❌ More complex to debug
- ❌ Probabilistic results
- ❌ Higher resource usage

**Best for:**
- Unstructured text
- Multiple languages
- High accuracy requirements
- Complex data types

## ML Models Used in Our Implementation

### 1. **Microsoft Presidio** (Primary)
- Comprehensive PII detection
- Supports 30+ entity types

- Transformer-based classification
- High accuracy for PII detection
- Trained on diverse PII datasets

### 3. **Zero-Shot Classification** (BART)
- `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
- No training needed for new types
- Flexible label definitions
- Good for rare data types

### 4. **Sentence Transformers**
- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Similarity-based detection
- Compares with reference examples
- Good for fuzzy matching

### 5. **BERT NER**
- `dslim/bert-base-NER`
- Token classification
- Identifies entities in context
- Good for names, locations

### 6. **Specialized Models**
- Credit card detector
- Email validator
- Phone number parser (with country detection)

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Regex-Based | ML-Based |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 70-80% | 90-95% |
| **Speed** | < 1ms | 10-100ms |
| **Memory** | < 10MB | 2-4GB |
| **GPU Required** | No | Preferred |
| **Setup Time** | Instant | 1-2 min (model loading) |
| **Maintenance** | High (pattern updates) | Low (model updates) |

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Phone Numbers
```
Input: "Call me at 555-1234"
Regex: ❌ Might miss (no area code)
ML: ✅ Understands context, detects as phone
```

### Example 2: Partial SSN
```
Input: "Last 4 of SSN: 1234"
Regex: ❌ Pattern doesn't match
ML: ✅ Understands "SSN" context
```

### Example 3: Obfuscated Email
```
Input: "john dot doe at example dot com"
Regex: ❌ No @ symbol
ML: ✅ Recognizes email pattern
```

### Example 4: International Formats
```
Input: "GB82 WEST 1234 5698 7654 32"
Regex: ⚠️ Needs specific IBAN pattern
ML: ✅ Recognizes as IBAN automatically
```

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

The best solution combines both approaches:

```python
def detect_data_type(text):
    # Fast regex check first
    regex_result = quick_pattern_check(text)
    if regex_result.confidence > 0.95:
        return regex_result
    
    # ML for uncertain cases
    ml_result = ml_model_detection(text)
    return ml_result
```

## When to Use Each

### Use Regex When:
- Processing millions of records
- Latency < 5ms required
- Running on edge devices
- Data follows strict formats
- Offline operation needed

### Use ML When:
- Accuracy is critical
- Handling user-generated content
- Multiple languages/formats
- Context matters
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)

## Cost Analysis

### Regex-Based:
- **Infrastructure**: $10-50/month (basic server)
- **Development**: High initial, ongoing maintenance
- **Operation**: Minimal

### ML-Based:
- **Infrastructure**: $200-1000/month (GPU instances)
- **Development**: Lower (pre-trained models)
- **Operation**: Model updates, monitoring

## Conclusion

While regex patterns are fast and simple, ML models provide significantly better accuracy and flexibility for real-world data type detection. The ML approach is particularly superior for:

1. **PII/Sensitive Data**: Critical for compliance
2. **International Data**: Handles multiple formats
3. **Noisy Data**: User input, OCR text, logs
4. **Contextual Detection**: Understanding partial information

For production systems, consider:
- **Hybrid approach** for best performance/accuracy
- **ML models** for critical data types
- **Regex** for well-defined, high-volume patterns
- **Caching** ML results for repeated data

## Implementation in Our Service

Our Triton service now supports both:

1. **data_type_detector**: Original regex-based (fast)
2. **data_type_detector_ml**: New ML-based (accurate)

You can choose based on your requirements:
```python
# Fast detection
client.detect_data_type(text, model="data_type_detector")

# Accurate detection  
client.detect_data_type(text, model="data_type_detector_ml")
```
